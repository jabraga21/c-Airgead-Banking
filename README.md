Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- This project was to show the users investment options. For example, a person would determine what monthly deposit they would like to put into an account, take the amount of time the users wanted and calcuate. After, the program would show two displays to the user, 1 diplay to show the user how the investement would grow over the years without additional deposits and the other WITH additonal deposits.
  
What did you do particularly well?
- Initally, I think I organized the code well, but got stuck with the code and how it functions. I also think that the display would have came out well. The thing I struggled with was the calcuation of despoits over time while attempting to use a vector.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- Looking back, I wish I had a little more time on it to get it to work. When I took this class it was a very busy time for me, so I struggled with finding the time to balance my school work, my two jobs, along with two kids.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- The hardest part for me was the calcuation park and this is where I feel like if this was a real life situation I could have utilized my team to do this part. I think I really enjoyed organizing the code and making it look pretty for the user, but for some reason my calcuations just didn't work through the vector. Overall, I didn't overcome it, but needed to just sumbit something for some points.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- I think the organziation piece is transferable and the way I split the files between the header and the main file. I think the base of a good code is here, but the functionality just didn't hit the mark.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-It's not, from the point of view of a beginner coder. I didn't add any comment lines or anything like I have in past projects as I felt I was pressed for time. I do however think that an experience programmer wouldn't have trouble reading it as I think there are some really good organziation in there. But regardless I'm disappointed that my code didn't work. C++ was a peticualarlly difficult code to write for me. 

Overall, this class was challenging for me, especially to do online in an 8 week course. I kind of wish I had the ability to take this class over as I always feel like when I take a long break from things and come back everything clicks. I think the way this class pushed me and allowed me to really push myself in a way I didn't think I would need too at the beginning of my semester. Either way I thank my professor for all the help he has provided. Off to the next class, and better time management on my part!
